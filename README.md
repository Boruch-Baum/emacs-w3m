# emacs-w3m

This is a fork of the [emacs-w3m](https://github.com/emacs-w3m/emacs-w3m) git repository. The `master` branch here  provides my tested modifications to the original, while the `bb_upstream`branch here _should_ track the official repository's `master` branch. Additionally, this fork will have unique branches for development experiments, projects, and pending pull requests.

## Unique branches here

* `bb_history-scrub`
  * New feature `w3m-history-scrub` (keybinding `S-C-delete`) to delete web browsing resources (history, cookies, cache, temporary files, form data).
