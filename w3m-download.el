;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides download features for the `emacs-w3m' project.
;; Although the project is meant to be a front-end to the `w3m'
;; browser, this code uses elisp and, when available, external
;; back-end programs (currently just `wget') in order to offer
;; additional download features not native to `w3m':
;;
;;   1) Individual detailed download progress logs in dedicated
;;      buffers, automatically deleted upon successful completion.
;;
;;   2) Partial downloads are stored on disk, not in memory (yes...).
;;
;;   3) Resumption of partial downloads that were interrupted due to
;;      aborts or other failures.
;;
;;   4) Optional appending of meta-data to a download, currently
;;      offered for png and jpeg files. The image link's "alt" caption
;;      is stored as meta-data element "Exif.Image.ImageDescription".
;;      Note that enabling this option will modify the file's
;;      checksum. This option currently uses `exif' and `exiv2' as
;;      external back-end programs.
;;
;;      4.1) Some ways to view from the command-line an embedded
;;           caption are:
;;             exiv2 -g "Exif.Image.ImageDescription" foo.png
;;             exif --ifd=0 -t0x010e  foo.jpg |grep value
;;
;; This file also absorbed most of the legacy download functions,
;; those which were basically wrappers for `w3m-download', to keep all
;; (most) functionality in one place. The functions and defcustom not
;; moved here are:
;;
;;   --FILE--
;;   mew-w3m.el    mew-w3m-ext-url-fetch (dummy url)
;;   w3m.el        w3m-external-view (url &optional no-cache handler)
;;   w3m-lnum.el   w3m-lnum-actions-image-alist
;;   w3m-lnum.el   w3m-lnum-save-image ()



;;; TODO
;; + danger of 'feature-creep': None of these-items are necessary, and
;;   at some point the project should consider turning to a en external
;;   program which specializes in downlaoding, but anyway ...
;;   + files in the process of being downloaded should have a
;;     temporary extension `.part' appended to their name, which would
;;     be removed upon successful completion, and possibly upon the
;;     pesky error code 1.
;;   + an alist of extensions and metadata commands
;;   + an alist of download commands (eg. aria2, curl)
;;   + offloading to a dedicated downloader (eg. uget)
;;   + persistence across crashes (ie. maintain a disk file)
;;   + warn if more than 'n' concurrent downloads in progress
;;   + queue when more than 'n' concurrent downloads in progress
;;   + renice download processes
;;   + pause a download
;;   + delete a partially downloaded file when manually aborted
;;     (eg. when killing the progress buffer)
;;   + replace individual progress buffers with a single buffer, and
;;     use the process-fiter function to maintain a dedicated section
;;     for each download. This would be similar to the 'look' of the
;;     download windows of many other browsers.
;;     + summary line at top of buffer.
;;     + download states could be color-coded.
;;     + click option to resume a download
;;     + click option to open a download

This sets a feature for function `w3m-download' that operates on
jpeg and png images, and saves their link 'alt' caption strings

From within emas-w3m you can see what the value would be by
moving point to the link (the string will appear in the
mini-buffer).

This operation is performed by calls to external programs; if
those programs are not executable on your system, a message will
be logged. Currently, the selected programs are hard-coded,
`exif' for jpeg files, and `exiv2' for png files.

Note that enabling this option will modify the file's checksum."
