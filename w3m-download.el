;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides download features for the `emacs-w3m' project.
;; Although the project is meant to be a front-end to the `w3m'
;; browser, this code uses elisp and, when available, external
;; back-end programs (currently just `wget') in order to offer
;; additional download features not native to `w3m':
;;
;;   1) Individual detailed download progress logs in dedicated
;;      buffers, automatically deleted upon successful completion.
;;
;;   2) Partial downloads are stored on disk, not in memory (yes...).
;;
;;   3) Resumption of partial downloads that were interrupted due to
;;      aborts or other failures.
;;
;;   4) Bulk downloading of a buffer's links or region's links,
;;      selectable by regex and a presentation buffer. Throughout
;;      the code, this feature is referred to as `download-select'.
;;
;;   5) Optional appending of meta-data to a download.
;;
;;      5.1) Defcustom `w3m-download-save-metadata' controls
;;           whether downloaded `png' and `jpeg' files should
;;           have their link's "alt" caption is stored as
;;           meta-data element "Exif.Image.ImageDescription".
;;           Note that enabling this option will modify the
;;           file's checksum. This option currently uses `exif'
;;           and `exiv2' as external back-end programs.
;;
;;           Some ways to view from the command-line an embedded
;;           caption are:
;;             exiv2 -g "Exif.Image.ImageDescription" foo.png
;;             exif --ifd=0 -t0x010e  foo.jpg |grep value
;;
;;      5.2) Defcustom `w3m-download-enable-xattr' controls
;;           whether to save a file's original URL and Referer
;;           HTTP header value. This feature uses the `wget'
;;           `--xattr' argument and thus requires that the
;;           save-path be on a file-system that supports extended
;;           attributes.
;;
;;           Be aware that the URL might contain private
;;           information like access tokens or credentials.
;;
;; This file also absorbed most of the legacy download functions,
;; those which were basically wrappers for `w3m-download', to keep all
;; (most) functionality in one place. The functions and defcustom not
;; moved here are:
;;
;;   --FILE--
;;   mew-w3m.el    mew-w3m-ext-url-fetch (dummy url)
;;   w3m.el        w3m-external-view (url &optional no-cache handler)
;;   w3m-lnum.el   w3m-lnum-actions-image-alist
;;   w3m-lnum.el   w3m-lnum-save-image ()



;;; Usage:

;; For downloading single items at point, there exist multiple
;; functions that seem redundant:
;;
;;     `w3m-download-this-url'
;;     `w3m-download-this-image'
;;     `w3m-save-image'
;;     `w3m-download-using-wget'
;;     `w3m-download-using-w3m'   (not recommended)
;;     `w3m-download'
;;
;; For downloading more than one link in a buffer or region:
;;
;;     `w3m-download-select'
;;
;; At any time, you can change the number of allowable
;; simultaneous downloads:
;;
;;     `w3m-download-increase-simultaneous'
;;     `w3m-download-decrease-simultaneous'
;;
;;     This is easiest done from a w3m-download-select buffer,
;;     where the functions are bound to the +/- keys.
;;
;; The current recommended way to kill a download in progress is
;; to kill its progress buffer. To kill all current downloads:
;;
;;     `w3m-download-delete-all-download-buffers'
;;     `w3m-download-kill-all-wget-processes'      (just an alias)
;;
;;     There also exists for now a slightly different function
;;     that was originally intended as a possible hook function:
;;
;;         `w3m-download-kill-all-asociated-processes'



;;; TODO:

;; + Easier way to find a particular download to kill
;; + function: w3m-download-select-exec
;;   + pre-screen the list of downloads for possible name conflicts
;;     with existing files, and duplicates, and prompt the user
;;     accordingly.
;;   + create a queue display buffer
;;     + delete items
;;     + re-order items
;;     + pause items
;; + `w3m--download-check-and-use-cache'
;;   + does not emulate `w3m-download-enable-xattr'
;; + danger of 'feature-creep': None of these-items are necessary, and
;;   at some point the project should consider turning to a en external
;;   program which specializes in downlaoding, but anyway ...
;;   + an alist of extensions and metadata commands
;;   + an alist of download commands (eg. aria2, curl, axel)
;;   + offloading to a dedicated downloader (eg. uget)
;;   + persistence across crashes (ie. maintain a disk file)
;;   + warn if more than 'n' concurrent downloads in progress
;;   + renice download processes
;;   + pause a download
;;   + delete a partially downloaded file when manually aborted
;;     (eg. when killing the progress buffer)
;;   + replace individual progress buffers with a single buffer, and
;;     use the process-fiter function to maintain a dedicated section
;;     for each download. This would be similar to the 'look' of the
;;     download windows of many other browsers.
;;     + summary line at top of buffer.
;;     + download states could be color-coded.
;;     + click option to resume a download
;;     + click option to open a download
;;   + torrent and magnet support
;;     + maybe do this using the type-alist for external helper
;;       programs?
;;   + Think about the need / desirability of hook functions to
;;     optionally kill running downloads, for `kill-emacs-hook'
;;     (without user interaction), `kill-emacs-query-functions'
;;     (with user interaction), and the mode exit hook for
;;     `emacs-w3m' (look it up, what is it?). Maybe there should
;;     also be download recovery/resume/re-attach hooks for either
;;     `after-init-hook', `emacs-startup-hook' or the startup hook
;;     for `emacs-w3m' (look it up, what is it?)

The external program `wget' is preferred if it is available. If
not, `w3m' is used.

When called interactively, URL at point is presumed. Otherwise,
the user is prompted for it. FILENAME defaults to the basename of
URL. With the prefix argument NO-CACHE is set non-nil.

HANDLER and POST-DATA are the standard emacs-w3m args for its
internal asynchronous process control and handling POST

INTERACTIVE is a boolean value for whether the calling function
